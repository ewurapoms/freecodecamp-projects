## Overview

This repo contains codes, projects and study notes taken from
my self-tutouring with Freecodecamp curriculum.

I will later provide a much structured/detailed description to this readme.

For now, I have just started with the new JavaScript interactive certification project
as a major part of my #100DaysCode challenge.

Other focus areas are:
- Responsive Web Design
- Frontend Development Libraries 
- Backend Development and APIs
